# WebTV Partition Editor

Mirror of the source code for the WebTV Partition Editor tool written by WebTV hacker Eric MacDonald (eMac). The tool allows users to mount and edit the proprietary hard drive partitions used by some [WebTV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSN_TV) (or MSN TV) internet set-top boxes onto their PC, either from a image file or a physical hard drive. The hard drives were used by WebTV Plus, Echostar DishPlayer, UltimateTV (DirecTV), and Japanese boxes.

A compiled version of this code already exists at https://turdinc.kicks-ass.net/Msntv/eMac/index.html. WebTV Partition Editor is confirmed to work on Windows 7 and higher, and will likely work on Windows Vista as well. WebTV Partition Editor also runs on Windows XP, but is known to crash when mounting physical drives(?)
